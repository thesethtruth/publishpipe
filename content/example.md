## Executive Summary

This is a sample document demonstrating publishpipe's markdown-to-PDF pipeline. Edit this file and watch the dev server hot reload your changes.

## Background

Publishpipe converts markdown files into print-ready PDFs using:

- **Nunjucks** templates for layout
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling consistency with your web presence
- **pagedjs-cli** for PDF rendering with proper pagination

## Key Points

1. Write your content in markdown with frontmatter metadata
2. Choose a template or create your own
3. Preview in the browser with hot reload
4. Export to PDF when ready

> This is a blockquote to show how they render in the default template.

## Next Steps

- Finalize content
- Review PDF output
- Share with stakeholders

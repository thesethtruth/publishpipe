## Introduction

This document demonstrates publishpipe's multi-chapter support. Each chapter is a separate markdown file, combined into a single PDF with consistent formatting.

The frontmatter from this first chapter provides the document-level metadata — title, subtitle, author, and date — which appear on the title page and in running headers.
